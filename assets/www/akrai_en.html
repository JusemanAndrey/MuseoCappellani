	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>
	<a href="images/akrai.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="images/akrai.jpg"></a>
	The ancient Akrai, to the west of the modern town of Palazzolo Acreide, is the oldest  sub-colony of Syracuse.  Its position on the natural fortress of Acremonte - a plateu between the valleys of the rivers Anapo in the south and Tellaro in the north - demonstrates that Akrai was founded for strategic reasons as it was an excellent lookout position over the hinterland in support of the defense of Syracuse. 
Little historical information is known about Akrai. According to the historian Thucydides, it was founded in 664/663 BC, 70 years after the foundation of the motherland. Plutarch records Akrai in relation to Dion’s march towards Syracuse in 357 BC. In 263 BC - after the peace treaty between Rome and Syracuse - Akrai, Leontinoi, Megara, Helorus, Noto and Taormina were included in the kingdom of Hiero II. It was the period of its greatest prosperity - partly because of a long time of peace - in which some of the most important monuments were built and a mint was active as it is proved by an issued bronze coin with the representation of Persephone and Demeter. In 214 BC, as Livy reports, the Syracuse leader Hippocrates took refuge in Akrai after his defeat by Marcellus. According to Pliny, after the Roman conquest, Akrai was included among the “civitates stipendiariae”(tribute-paying communities enforced to pay tribute to Rome).
After a long period of obscurity, the city prospered again between the IV and V century AD, becoming a center of considerable importance as it is well-demonstrated by the great catacombs and hypogea in the surrounding territory. In 827 it was conquered by the Arabs; in the following centuries, the medieval Palatiolum developed around a castle built in the early years of the Norman kingdom. Then, in 1693 it was destroyed by the earthquake and on the same site the present Palazzolo Acreide was rebuilt in line with the Baroque style and with the ancient urban plan.

	Akrai stands on the top of a hill not easily accessible; it was surraunded by walls following the edge of the terrace, where there were two gates known as "selinuntina " to the west and "siracusana" to the east.    
The most recent research has shown an urban plan with a rational and homogeneous distribution of space, it was also planned taking into consideration the environmental conditions of the site. The road (plateia), oriented EW, constituted the most important road axis and it connected the two gates of the city. A stretch of about 250 m. and 4.00 m wide was brought to light, it was paved with lava stone dating back to the late Hellenistic period. This axis was intercepted by diagonal roads (stenopoi) - about 3 meters wide - two stenopoi to the south and five to the north of the road axis. These stenopoi intersected the plateia obliquely and those to the north were aligned with those to the south. The urban plan dates back to the VI century B.C, so far it shows two building phases (Hellenistic and Roman period ). To the west the plateia opened on square, which was also paved, while to the east bordered the scene of the theater, which was perfectly integrated within the urban scheme. Remains still visible today include: the theater, the nearby bouleuterion, the archaic temple, which marks the sacred Acropolis and the adjacent quarries known as “the Intagliata” and “the Intagliatella”. Outside the town, on the slopes of Acremonte, there are two sacred areas of great interest: the "Feral temples" and "I Santoni" and the necropolis of the city were located on the close by hills of Colle Orbo and Pinita.

	<h1>The City Walls</h1>
	<p>
	<a href="images/akrai_muraurbiche1.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="images/akrai_muraurbiche1.jpg"></a>
	The city wall, running mostly along the edge of Acremonte, leant on the natural defences of the land, encompassing an area of approximately ..... However, few traces remain visibile near the entrance of the archaeological site. On the western side, in the centre of the extensive plateau recess, probably the “selinuntina door’’ opened, this lead onto the road to Selinunte mentioned in an inscription (Kaibel 217). Probably a second door opened along the eastern side leading to Syracuse.
       According to the typology, the walls date between the beginning of the 4th century. B.C. and the second half of the 3rd century. B.C.

	<h1>The Necropoles</h1>
	<p>
	<a href="images/akrai_necropoli1.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="images/akrai_necropoli1.jpg"></a>
	The necropolis of the ancient Akrai are located on the close by hills of Colle Pineta and Colle Orbo.
The necropolis of Colle Pineta, excavated at different stages between 1810 and 1817 by Barone Judica, occupies the top plateau of the hill and covers about 7 hectares, it was active between the 7th century BC and the first decades of the 5th century BC. The tombs are rectangular pits covered with slabs with depositions orientated to the East. After the excavations lead by Judica, the necropolis was almost destroyed by illegal excavations; most of the grave goods were lost, while some ended up in the Bonelli-Ferla collection, which was later acquired and added to the Judica collection. The extension of the necropolis of Colle Orbo is still unknown.  Also excavated by Gabriele Judica in 1809, it consists of pit tombs, more recent than those in the Pineta. The Hellenistic period tombs are comparable to the coeval necropolis of Syracuse for their typology and grave goods.

	<h1>The Santoni</h1>
	<a name="santoni"></a>

	Located in a picturesque background along the southern slopes of Colle Orbo towards the bottom of the valley, the so-called "Santoni" or "Santicelli" - with its series of reliefs is exceptional evidence of the cult of the Phrygian goddess Cybele. There are twelve reliefs, framed by arched niches, perhaps arranged as small places of worship (naiskoi).
Unknown to scholars of the 16th  and 17th  centuries, Ignazio Paternò Castello, Prince of Biscari, was the first to mention them in 1771, while the representations by Jean Houel date back to 1787. In addition Luigi Bernabò Brea (1956) provided the definite exegesis of the representations as an expression of the cult of Cybele, as confirmed by recent studies.
The goddess - identified by attributes such as the polos on her head, the timpani (a kind of tambourine) and the patera (a kind of large bowl)- with lions at the foot of the throne or on the legs, is normally depicted sitting (she is standing only in two reliefs). She is usually accompanied by figures placed or at head height or at leg level, often on different levels, or on the side of the niche walls. These figures relate to the cult of Cybele, such as Hermes with the caduceus, Hecate (a young woman holding a torch), the Corybantes (followers of the cult), Marsyas, Attis and the Dioscuri. Also the other figures, not very clear, were connected to the character of the goddess, rather than the rites celebrated in her honor. The cult, originating from Phrygia, spread in Attica in the 5th BC and then throughout the Greek world. Similar references of the representation of the goddess, repeated several times along the cliff face, are found in the sanctuaries of Asia Minor, where this kind of cult is widely practiced. The presence of minor figures related to the cult of the goddess testifies innovative aspects in comparison to those in Attica. They are also of great interest because of the particular location of this structure, geographically distant from Phrygia. With regards to dating, the stylistic comparisons and the few data collected suggest between late 3rd and early 2nd century BC.

	<h1>The bouleuterion</h1>

	<a href="images/akrai_bouleuterion4.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="bouleuterion"><img src="images/akrai_bouleuterion4.jpg"></a>
	The bouleuterion (seat of the city Senate) was discovered in 1820 by Gabriele Judica. In 1944 the excavation was completed by Luigi Bernabò Brea. The bouleuterion consists of a cavea – facing west- within a quadrangular space which was originally covered. The cavea includes six rows of seats, divided into three cunei by two stepladders. The small orchestra was semi-circular with a clay court floor The room was accessible through a middle front door, approximately 4 meters high, and the orator stood in front of the Assembly. Probably the façade had a gable, and the presence of windows on the front is uncertain.
Near the bouleuterion there is a visible well, which along with others guaranteed the water supply to the city.
An underground passage connects the bouleuterion to the upper part of the cavea.

	<h1>The Theatre</h1>

	<a href="images/akrai_teatro2.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="teatro"><img src="images/akrai_teatro2.jpg"></a>
	The theater was discovered in 1824 by Gabriele Judica, who undertook the excavation of the scene, the orchestra and the lower steps of the cavea, he also conducted the restoration work and part of the reconstruction. The excavation was completed in the ‘50s by Luigi Bernabò Brea.
The theater is located on the slope of the terrain but only five middle cunei lie on it, while the other four (two per side) lie on artificial foundations. The cavea, according to the traditional criterions, faces north overlooking a landscape of outstanding natural beauty, dominated by Etna. The monument is small, a perfect semicircle with nine cunei separated by eight stairways. The cunei are not all equal: the first and the second are entirely redone, while the others were partially integrated. The anterior part of each step was higher than the posterior which was used for the feet of the spectators in the row above; each row corresponds to two steps, made from a single block. The orchestra is perfectly semicircular and the front of the stage coincides with the diameter of the orchestra. The parodoi (side corridors leading to the theater) are missing; spectators entered the terraces from the front. The installation of the theater dates back to III century B.C. and it is in line with the monumentalization plan promoted by Hiero II. Some changes are attributed to the Roman period.

	On the hill overlooking the theater from the south, at the highest point of the city, there is an archaic temple (second half of the 6th century BC. , excavations by Luigi Bernabò Brea, 1953). Only the foundations of the temple remain, over time the materials of the elevated part were reused for the construction of the modern city. There is a difference in levels in sections of the foundations: where they were deeper, to find a more solid rock, the difference in level was filled by blocks placed in a regular fashion. The foundations of the peristasis (perimetral colonnade) and of the interior parts are both visible.
The plan of the temple was reconstructed through the study of the foundations. It had a peristasis of 6x13 Doric columns, which enclosed the inner part (sekos). The latter presents a particular division of the interior spaces; a pronao with two columns “in antis” and a second row of columns on the front was followed by a kind of anteroom or vestibule and by a cella or adyton. .
	Apart from the side section of the altar decorated with lyre and palmette motif  (now in the Museo Archeologico Regionale "Paolo Orsi" in Syracuse), no other traces of it have been found. Probably a fragment of a  large, clay, male figure statue (from the second half of the 6th century BC) belongs to the temple.
 The attribution of this building is complex, on the basis of the inscription IG 217 Luigi Bernabò Brea identifies it as the temple dedicated to Aphrodite, but based on the same inscription more recent studies have identified it with a Koreion. Recently, this hypothesis was strengthened by the discovery, in the vicinity, of a cultural structure referred to as a thesmophorion (place of worship of the chthonian deities Demeter and Kore).

	<a href="images/akrai_latomie6.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="latomie"><img src="images/akrai_latomie6.jpg"></a>
	Within the city, east of the theatre, we find the vast “latomie” (stone quarries: from the Greek temnein which means “to cut”)  of “the Intagliata” and “the Intagliatella”. The walls not only  retain traces of the extraction of stone blocks but also show evidence of different uses over time representing some of the most significant moments in the history of the city. A series of small rectangular recesses housed small boards (pinakes) of embossed stone or painted, wooden boards with representations in honour of deceased heroes in line with common tradition of Syracuse and  other areas of eastern Sicily. They testify a strong religious component during the period of greatest prosperity of the city. Later, the vertical walls of the quarries allowed the Christian grave diggers to build hypogea and small catacombs, by sometimes cutting the votive recesses. During the Middle Ages they opened several caves which were used as rock dwellings.
	The L-shaped “Intagliatella” is characterized by the presence of the now mutilated large relief along the western wall consisting of two close but distinct scenes. The first on the left represents a sacrifice: a quadrangular altar in the center, a standing warrior on the right and a male figure; a young helper (camillus) behind the altar involved in the ceremony. On the left there are two figures of camilli in short tunics. The second scene depicts the heroes at a banquet: two figures  lying on the kline and a female figure at their feet, on the right; a sumptuously laid table. The relief (first half of first century BC) is of modest artistic value, but it is an interesting example of the fusion between the Greek cultural tradition, from which the religious conception derives, and the full Roman style, as shown by the clothes worn by the figures.
	From a hypogeum excavated on the eastern wall, a few fragments of inscriptions recalling the names of the deceased buried there (Alphia and Euthychia) were discovered. 
	The oval shaped “Intagliata” includes two distinct parts; in the southwest there is a complex of catacombs, hypogea, and arcosolium burials of Christian age. Some of these are notable for the presence of carefully worked transennae around the canopied sepulchres. The remaining part is characterized by rock dwellings with large, square rooms with flat ceilings, some isolated and others in connected groups. A large hypogeum, known as “La grotta dei cavalli” (the horses’ cave), consists of four rooms and has a long, winding tunnel 23 meters long, built to find the water table.

	A large quarry stands on the eastern side of the Akrai hill. The top strata are compact and hard whereas the lower strata are yellowish and soft. It is here, on the rock face, that once the quarry was no longer used for the extraction of blocks, a unique series of small, regular, rectangular recesses were realised; they were recesses housing bas-reliefs or painted wooden boards (pinakes) with representations in honor of deceased heroes. On the walls, arranged in various ways, there are also many repetitive inscriptions, such as eros agathos (virtuous hero) and agathos daimon (virtuous or noble spirit).
Two large recesses open out here; two large niches in the center of the arch of the quarry. Research conducted in the area of the northern recess shows evidence that it originally opened onto a kind of terrace above ground level of the quarry. There are several cavities both inside and outside. A series of small holes dug in the ground contained offerings in honor of the deceased. A similar situation is found in the southern recess where, in addition to a press we find a circular pit,  possibly of more recent age, formed by blocking one of the trenches of the quarry. Probably the bas-relief that Gabriele Judica unearthed in fragments was found in one of the large nooks of the southern recess.

	<h1>Studies and research</h1>
	<p>
	The first studies on the location of the ancient city date back to the XVI century . The first to identify the exact site of Akrai was Tommaso Fazello (1558).
At the end of ‘700, Prince Ignazio Paternò Castello visited the remains of the ancient Akrai and he was the first to note the sculptures known as "The Santoni".
In the XIX century Baron Gabriel Judica began some serious archaeological research. Thanks to his passionate work, important findings both within and outside the ancient city were discovered.
Following the research carried by various scholars, among which the work conducted by the great archaeologist Paolo Orsi, comprehensive excavation within the city were undertaken by Luigi Bernabò Brea, in 1953. The excavations brought to light the archaic temple on the sacred Acropolis, part of the theater and the feral temples.
In the '60s Joseph Voza focused his studies on the city plan, defining part of the road system.
	The latest research (Maria Musumeci ) was carried out in two areas: one between the theater and the temple – were a thesmophorion (a sanctuary dedicated to Demeter and Kore- the chthonian deities) was discovered; and the other in the area of a circular public building, with an adjacent porch (Giuseppe Voza ). The latest research carried out by Roksana Chowaniec of the University of Warsaw  and by Lorenzo Guzzardi revealed the presence of Roman structures in the living area.
